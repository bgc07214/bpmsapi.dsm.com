This has a direct impact on Rohingya repatriation. In 2021, the government before the army seized power was persuaded by Bangladesh to repatriate. Later, after the junta took power, communication was stopped for a long time. However, after some visible steps in the repatriation of Rohingyas, the civil war situation in Arakan took a new complicated shape. Experts say that in the current situation there, Bangladesh will have to keep in touch with the armed rebel group Arakan Army to repatriate the Rohingya in the coming days.<\/p>\n<p>The situation in Myanmar is changing rapidly. The rebel groups are occupying one area after another. The junta is losing control in many places. This has added a new dimension to the Rohingya crisis.<\/p>\n<p>The Arakan Army has recently captured an important area near the Bangladesh-India border.<br \/>\nHowever, diplomatic sources in Dhaka and Naypyidaw say that the junta is not at all upset about what the Arakan Army has done or how much land it has occupied. Because, even if the whole of Rakhine is occupied, the Arakan Army will fear losing that area again until the junta admits that it has lost or lost the territory. And if the junta wants to, it can immediately recover the lost areas by naval, air and army.<\/p>\n<p>But the question arises, why the junta is losing these areas. A diplomat told Samakal on condition of anonymity that the areas occupied by the Arakan Army are almost all jungle and inaccessible. Myanmar is not willing to spend more resources and troops in these areas. Many of the army are leaving the service as they have been in the war for a long time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The situation in Myanmar is becoming increasingly complicated.
