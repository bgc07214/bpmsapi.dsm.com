										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>However, Japa General Secretary Mujibul Haque Chunnu is not willing to give importance to this activity of the opposition. He said, those who have resigned, they are welcome if they form a new party. This bodes well for democracy. But if the sponsor is Roshan Ershad, it remains to be seen.</p>
<p>There was tension in Japan even before the election. It has increased after the January 7 election landslide. Several senior leaders including Co-Chairman Kazi Feroze Rasheed have lost their posts after criticizing the leadership of Japa Chairman GM Quader for taking part in the election only after getting concession of seats from Awami League for his wife Sherifa Quader.</p>
<p>Several candidates of the party withdrew from the election before the polls. Their complaint was that GM Quader received money from the government for participating in the elections. He did not take notice of the candidates put to the vote. Opposition has gained a new dimension with the news that Sherifa Kader, who lost his bail in the last election, will go to the 12th Parliament in the reserved seat. In a press conference led by the ousted presidium member Shafiqul Islam, Japa announced the resignation of about 700 leaders at the metropolitan, police station and ward levels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is known that the procession was led by Johnny Hasan Labu, President of Municipal Jubo League, at Singra Bus Stand area at 11:30 am on Friday. In the viral video, it can be seen that most of the people who took part in the procession were carrying different types of indigenous weapons. Some of them had ramadas, some iron rods, Chinese axes and hansua. Half a hundred activists took part in the march led by Labu wearing a helmet. Among them, Bayjid Hossain, president of Ward No. 9 of Municipal Jubo League, Anwar Hossain Saudagar, former Publicity and Publication Secretary of Municipal Volunteer League, Barat Ali Saudagar and Jahangir Saudagar, Jubo League workers, were seen holding weapons. The office of the CNG-powered Auto-Rickshaw Owners Association was vandalized while chanting slogans. Panic spread in the area when people openly marched with arms on the Natore-Bogra highway.</p>
<p>Singra Municipal Jubo League President Johnny Hasan Labu said that the administration could not stop extortion in public transport for 15 years. Therefore, this march has been done with the traders with weapons to stop the levy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ranju Mondal, general secretary of the CNG-driven auto-rickshaw owners association, did not give any answer when asked about the reason for not filing a case in the case of office vandalism. However, he said, the incident happened due to a misunderstanding. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The situation in Myanmar is becoming increasingly complicated. This has a direct impact on Rohingya repatriation. In 2021, the government before the army seized power was persuaded by Bangladesh to repatriate. Later, after the junta took power, communication was stopped for a long time. However, after some visible steps in the repatriation of Rohingyas, the civil war situation in Arakan took a new complicated shape. Experts say that in the current situation there, Bangladesh will have to keep in touch with the armed rebel group Arakan Army to repatriate the Rohingya in the coming days.</p>
<p>The situation in Myanmar is changing rapidly. The rebel groups are occupying one area after another. The junta is losing control in many places. This has added a new dimension to the Rohingya crisis.</p>
<p>The Arakan Army has recently captured an important area near the Bangladesh-India border.<br />
However, diplomatic sources in Dhaka and Naypyidaw say that the junta is not at all upset about what the Arakan Army has done or how much land it has occupied. Because, even if the whole of Rakhine is occupied, the Arakan Army will fear losing that area again until the junta admits that it has lost or lost the territory. And if the junta wants to, it can immediately recover the lost areas by naval, air and army.</p>
<p>But the question arises, why the junta is losing these areas. A diplomat told Samakal on condition of anonymity that the areas occupied by the Arakan Army are almost all jungle and inaccessible. Myanmar is not willing to spend more resources and troops in these areas. Many of the army are leaving the service as they have been in the war for a long time.</p>

<p>About five hundred farmers were present in the meeting held in the courtyard of farmer Indu Bhushan Pal Niru of Noagaon village of Srimangal upazila on Saturday morning. Agriculture Minister asked the farmers why the land of Aman paddy harvesting village is still fallow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Babri Masjid, there was a Hindu temple at the site of Gnanabapi Masjid in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India, according to the Archeology Department of the country. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has conducted a survey on this. As a result of the survey, it is claimed that there was a temple there before the construction of the mosque. The mosque was built in 1669 by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. BBC news</p>
<p>In the middle of last year, the Varanasi District Court ordered the ASI to conduct a survey of the mosque premises. Based on four months of survey, scientific observations, study of architectural features, patterns, inscriptions, art and sculptures, it is easy to say that a Hindu temple existed there before the construction of the present structure, the published survey report said.</p>
<p>Anupam Dwivedi, lawyer for plaintiff Rakhi Singh in the case, termed the survey as very important. He said, &#8216;This report will strengthen our case. It is very important for the cases in terms of evidence.&#8217;</p>
<p>However, Muslims have informed that they received a copy of the ASI report last Thursday night. SM Yasin, joint secretary of Anjuman Intezamiya Mosque, who is in charge of managing the Gnanabapi Masjid, said, &#8220;This is a report, not a judgment.&#8221; The report is of 839 pages. It will take time to survey and analyze. Lawyers and experts will be consulted. Then it will be taken to the court for consideration.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US State Department informed the US Congress on Friday night of the formal approval of the fighter jets. The ministry told Congress that an agreement to sell fighter jets to Greece as well as Turkey has been approved. Under the agreement, the United States will provide 40 F-35 fighter jets to Greece for $8.6 billion. </p>
<p>In 2021, Turkey applied to the United States to buy the first advanced fighter jet. However, Turkey&#8217;s refusal to accept Sweden&#8217;s NATO membership has left tensions in the alliance. As a result, the US did not approve the sale of warplanes to Ankara. Turkey objects, Sweden supports and harbors Kurdish separatists. TÃ¼rkiye has identified the Kurds as a terrorist group.</p>
<p>However, after more than a year, Turkish parliamentarians approved Sweden&#8217;s application on January 23. After only four days, the United States approved the sale of the warplane. </p>
